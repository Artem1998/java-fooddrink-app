## About ##
This is desctop application for ordering food and drinks. The first feature is the user has to authenticate, so he can see only his previous orders. The application has order history and graphical charts for representing how the user sepnts money. For the database I was using **MySQL**. For desktop application development I was using **Javafx** with **Jfoniex**
